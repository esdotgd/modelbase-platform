# Modelbase Platform
This is the place to recommend new models/providers/developers/formats ("entities"), report bugs with the website or API, or suggest new features. We don't have a formal process at the moment, simply make a new issue describing the entity/bug/feature and we'll look into it.

## This is not the SDK!
For anything specific to the Modelbase SDK, please visit the appropriate repository: https://github.com/esdotgd/modelbase-sdk
